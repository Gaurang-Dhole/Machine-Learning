# Machine-Learning

Welcome to the **Machine-Learning** repository! This project is a collection of machine learning algorithms, models, and experiments designed to help users learn and apply machine learning concepts using various techniques and tools.

## Features

- Implementation of classic machine learning algorithms
- Experimentation with real-world datasets
- Tutorials and annotated code for educational purposes
- Scripts for data preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization

## Technologies Used

This repository may include code written in:
- Python (most common for ML tasks)
- Jupyter Notebooks (for interactive exploration)
- Supporting scripts or documentation

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Gaurang-Dhole/Machine-Learning.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**  
   Most projects here use Python packages. It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    cd Machine-Learning
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Explore notebooks and scripts:**  
   Open Jupyter Notebooks or run Python scripts as provided in various folders.
